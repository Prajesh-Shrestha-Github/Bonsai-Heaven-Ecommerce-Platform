            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The e-commerce sector has experienced rapid growth during the past 20 years.
             It results from increasing customer engagement, interest, and demand. 
             As B2B e-commerce grew at the same time as B2C e-commerce, this trend is still going strong globally and will be evident in the upcoming years.
             The B2B and B2C e-commerce industries have developed and been there for a while thanks primarily to technology. 
             Consumers are using a variety of tools to estimate pricing, locate deals, stores,
             and alternatives as technology transforms how they engage with businesses and one another.

       <h2>Positive Impact</h2>
       <h3>Here are some positive-impacts in the followings:</h3>
       <ul>

          On social networking networks, promoting a service or a company is simple.</li>
        <li>Customer support services: ensuring that customers are satisfied is important and is made simpler by technology. 
             Customers can contact tiny franchisees or the company's web portals to file a complaint or ask a question from anywhere in the world.</li>
        <li>Emails: 
          Just like text messages, emails are a text-based method of communication that allow us to immediately send essential papers and photographs from afar.
          Organizations utilize email to share official papers and employ quick applications for business.</li>

             <h2>Negative Impact</h2>
             <h3>Here are some negaive-impacts in the followngs:</h3>
              <ul>
               <li>Technology dependency in business: 
               Technology dependence is a major worry. Numerous digital tools and applications have been created to conduct business and support distant operations.
               We use technology so frequently that it has altered the way we do business, which is having a terrible negative impact on our company.
               A technological hiccup of any size can halt commercial operations. The practice of purchasing online over the internet serves as a prime illustration.
               Because there is no other means to do business, if the online store's webserver experiences any problems, it will be cut off from its customers and the entire process would halt.
               In the contemporary world, technology is dictating how we live. And in accordance with it, we have shaped our lives.
               Credit cards, cryptocurrencies, mobile transactions, and robots used for production and processing are a few examples of this dependence.
               </li>

               <li>Technology-related security risks:
               Businesses rely on computers and other digital equipment to run their operations. Because of their reliance on technology, organizations now face security threats.
               The bulk of commercial transactions and dealings are completed online and using computers.
               Any negligence on the part of staff members might provide rivals, hackers, or internet scammers access to your company's information.
               Cybercriminals are always looking for weak points to exploit and defraud you in your organization. A 2016 poll found that 32% of firms were impacted by hacking.
               Hackers have the ability to acquire passwords, sensitive information, and bank account information, which might lead to millions of dollars in damages. 
               A recent study found that hackers made over $10 billion in 2011.
               </li>

               <li>Technology-related interruptions at work: Workers are using technology to operate more productively and efficiently. But this technology is also taking their focus off of their jobs and diverting their attention.
               We are all addicted to utilizing our mobile phones for a variety of activities, including continual online and social media browsing.
               The interruptions from various social networking applications and email notifications on phones might occur in the midst of work, and the designated work hours are spoilt by socializing via apps, emails, or text messages, which in turn severely reduces your productivity level.
               These disruptions have a detrimental impact on employee productivity and can slow down development.
               Office workers reportedly receive more than 100 emails every day on average. 
               An adequate quantity of work time can be used by that many emails.

           <p>CONCLUSION
            This article examines the effects of technology on online commerce, in which a number of businesses sell a variety of goods. In short, due to infrastructure issues and low computer literacy, world's e-commerce industry has several challenges in web marketing. Most of the consumers are from rural regions and have limited computer and internet skills. Due to the fact that some urban clients lack credit options, only urban classes with access to computers and the internet may purchase and sell things online. 
            If Indian marketers consider the qualities of a quality website, they will undoubtedly succeed in marketing in foreign markets.
